# Raffle-fcc
this is not the actual readme file yet 
but I had to just scribble something 
to help understand what this contract is about

this is a smart contract for a raffle
which uses the vrfCoordinator for automation 
the checkUpkeep and performUpkeep functions monitor the 
state of the players involved
